# Uno Card Game Project

This project is a version of the classic Uno Card Game.

## Branches

- **Terminal/Game Logic Branch**: Most of the logic and coding, especially for now (as of 2/25/2025), will be in this branch.
- **Unity Branch**: After the game logic is fully working, I will transition this into a full game on Unity. Both 2D and 3D versions will happen, but I will start with 2D.

## Project Progress

This project has been great so far, and I am really enjoying it. The use of Enums and the thinking through of what Data Structures/Algorithms to use has been really fun.
