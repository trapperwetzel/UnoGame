Video Game project I making, a version of the class Uno Card Game. 
Most of the logic and coding, especially for now (as of 2/25/2025) will be in the terminal/game logic branch.
Then after the game logic is fully working, I will transition this into a full game on Unity. Both 2D and 3D versions will happen, but I will start with 2D. 
This project has been great so far and I am really enjoying it. The use of Enums and the thinking through of what Data Structures/Algorithms to use has been really fun.
